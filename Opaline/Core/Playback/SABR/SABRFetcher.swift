/// rolling buffer, no prefetch and no notion of the stream being "at" a
/// position — the player's own buffering does that job, and every request
/// states afresh where it wants bytes from.

/// What persists between requests is only what the server needs to keep the
/// session coherent: the last segment seen per format, the playback cookie and
/// the backoff it asked for.
